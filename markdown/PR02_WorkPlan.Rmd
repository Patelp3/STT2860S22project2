**Work Plan/Assignments**

We will be doing the analysis of dataset while in he class period and the graph plotting will be done by ourselves, 
Each one will be doing atleast 2 graphs

**Completion Timeline**

2 days for dataset analysis and rest for graphs, Last day would be only for reviewing each others work

**Communication Plan**

the snapchat group that we made during the last project would be our first preference. but we might just use the forums just incase for important information!
