## Setup

### Packages Used

```{r loadpackages}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```

### Datasets Used

#### Background of the Data

Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin, studied the relationship between parent heights and the heights of their offspring. His pioneering [1886 article](https://galton.org/essays/1880-1889/galton-1886-jaigi-regression-stature.pdf) is the first appearance of regression analysis in print. He originated many statistical terms and concepts, including regression, correlation, deviate, quartile, and percentile, plus median for the midpoint of a distribution. The `galtonheightdata` dataset was [created under the direction of Dr. James A. Hanley](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/galton/) using Galton's [original paper notebooks](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/galton/notebook/index.html) containing the measurement data. You can access the `galtonfamiliesmain.csv` and `galtonfamiliessub.csv` datasets from the [description](https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/Datasets/InstructorDescriptions/galtonheightdata.html) page. A third dataset, `galtonfamiliesnotebook.csv`, shows the notebook page on which each family's information was recorded.

#### Galton Main Dataset

```{r loadmaindata}
data_main <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/galtonfamiliesmain.csv")
```

#### Galton Subset Dataset

```{r loadsubdata}
data_sub <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/galtonfamiliessub.csv")
```

#### Galton Notebook Dataset

```{r loadnotebook}
data_notebook <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/galtonfamiliesnotebook.csv")
```

## Analyses

### Create the Analysis Datasets

#### Dataset #1

Load the three Galton datasets and use `glimpse()` to explore their structures. Refer to Project 1 and use the new data binding/joining skills you have learned to assemble a single dataset that meets the following criteria. Use `glimpse()` and `head()` to display the result. (Hint: Use `bind_rows()` to connect the `main` and `sub` datasets, then use a join to add the `notebook` information.)

* contains these variables:
   * `familyid` = ID number of the family, with `136A` recoded as `205`
   * `page` = the notebook page on which the family is recorded
   * `num_children`= the number of children in the family
   * `father_ht` = the height of the father
   * `mother_ht` = the "transmuted" (per Galton) height of the mother
   * `midparent` = the average of the parents' heights (using transmuted mother)
   * `child_sex`= whether the child is a son or a daughter, in all lower case
   * `child_ht` = the height of the child with daughter heights "transmuted"
   
* is arranged according to:
   * ascending order of familyid
   * sons before daughters within family
   * in order of height within each sex of child

```{r assembledata1}

data_main <- data_main %>%
  mutate(
    family_id = as.numeric(ifelse(FamilyID == "136A", 205, FamilyID)),
    mother_ht = Mother * 1.08,
    midparent = (Father + mother_ht) / 2,
    child_ht = ifelse(Child == "Daughter", Height * 1.08, Height)
  ) %>%
  select(
    family_id,
    num_children = Children,
    father_ht = Father,
    mother_ht,
    midparent,
    child_sex = Child,
    child_ht
  ) %>%
  arrange(
    family_id,
    desc(child_sex),
    desc(child_ht)
  )

glimpse(data_main)

data_sub <- data_sub %>%
  mutate(
    father_ht = FatherR + 60,
    mother = MotherR + 60,
    mother_ht = mother * 1.08,
    midparent = (father_ht + mother_ht) / 2,
    height = HeightR + 60,
    child_ht = ifelse(Child == "Daughter", height * 1.08, height)
  ) %>%
  select(
    family_id = FamilyID,
    num_children = Children,
    father_ht,
    mother_ht,
    midparent,
    child_sex = Child,
    child_ht
  ) %>%
  arrange(
    family_id,
    desc(child_sex),
    desc(child_ht)
  )

glimpse(data_sub)

data_notebook <- data_notebook %>%
   select(
      family_id = FamilyID,
      Page
   )


data_notebook$family_id <- as.double(data_notebook$family_id)

glimpse(data_notebook)

dataset1 <- bind_rows(data_main, data_sub) %>%
inner_join(data_notebook, by = "family_id") %>%
arrange(
   family_id,
   desc(child_ht)
)

glimpse(dataset1)
head(dataset1)
```

#### Dataset #2

From Dataset #1, select the variables `familyid` and `num_children`, then reduce the dataset so it contains only one unique row per family. Use `glimpse()` to display the result. (Hint: The final dataset should have 205 rows/observations and two variables/columns.)

```{r assembledata2}
dataset2 <- dataset1 %>%
  select(family_id, num_children) %>%
  distinct()

glimpse(dataset2)
```

### Visualization 1: Updated Scatterplot

#### Galton's Visualization

In his original paper (linked above), Galton created several tables and diagrams. His "Diagram Based on Table 1" of them is similar in concept to a scatterplot. Rather than dots, he grouped/tabulated the data, and then used the count of how many people were grouped at the coordinate pairs in his grid, with child as the x-axis and mid-parent as the y-axis. There are two scales: inches and deviations from 68.25 inches.

```{r galtonscatterplot, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "../images/galtonplot.png")
```

#### Your Data Visualization

**This plot uses Dataset #1.**

Create a scatterplot of child height (x-axis) versus mid-parent height (y-axis). Ordinarily, we might reverse the axes here because analysts would be more likely to model child height as a function of parent height, but we want to be able to compare the updated plot to Galton's original.

Include the following.

* make your dots larger than the default size to help show density
* set transparency to adjust for overplotting and help show density
* use `color =` in the `aes` to differentiate sons versus daughters
* use `scale_color_manual()` to choose two colorblind-safe colors
* scale both axes so that there is a tick mark at every whole inch
* use `coord_fixed()` so that the axes have the same unit spacing
* add better x- and y-axis labels, including the units of measure
* add an informative title (you may optionally include a subtitle)
* add `color =` to `labs()` to set the legend title to `"gender of child"` 
* use a built-in theme (e.g., `theme_linedraw()`) to add formatting
* use `theme()` to move the legend to the bottom of the scatterplot

```{r updatedscatterplot}
ggplot(dataset1, aes(x = child_ht, y = midparent, color = child_sex)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("orange", "blue")) +
  coord_fixed() +
  labs(x = "Child Height in inches", y = "mid-parent height in inches", title = "Plot of Child Height (Inches) vs. mid-parent Height (Inches)", color = "gender of child") +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
  

```

### Visualization 2: Number of Children

**This plot uses Dataset #2.**

Create a barplot to show the distribution of the number of children per family. Set the bars to something other than the default `width`. Scale the x-axis so that there is a tick mark for each bar. Choose appropriate colors, labels, themes, and/or and other types of formatting that you feel will enhance the meaning or visual appearance of the plot.  (Hint: Use `count()` to find out how many families have a given number of children, then use that information to create your plot.)

```{r childrenbarplot}
ggplot(dataset2, aes(x = family_id, y = num_children)) +
  geom_col()
```
